# webview-capture-new-window

this is an example of a windows 10 html webview captureing a new window and opeining it in the same weview instead of the browser

in this scenerio my entire app is in the web context just like it would be if you pointed to cotent on the webserver.  *NOTE* default.html can also be hosted on yoru web server so that the entire package can be hosted.
